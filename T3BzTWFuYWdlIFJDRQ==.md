## Summary
A **Remote Code Execution** vulnerability was found in OpsManage, which is a Automated Operations and Maintenance Platform. This vulnerability exists in the file **./apps/api/views/deploy_api.py**. In the `deploy_host_vars()` function, when this handler receives an HTTP POST request, if the **`id`** parameter results in a non-empty SQL query, the **`host_vars`** variable will accept the parameters from the request, passing external data into the `eval()` function for execution, ultimately leading to the vulnerability.

## Version
v3.0.1 â‰¤ version â‰¤ v3.0.5

## Source Code From
(OpsManage v3.0.5.tar.gz)[https://github.com/welliamcao/OpsManage/archive/refs/tags/v3.0.5.tar.gz]

## Code Analysis
In the latest version (v3.0.5), it is observed that the function `deploy_host_vars(request, id, format=None)` in the file **/apps/api/views/deploy_api.py** is an API endpoint that accepts both GET and POST requests.

The route for this handler consists of two parts, and the final complete route looks like this: `/api/host/vars/123/` (where 123 is the id).

In the first try..except block, the model Assets queries the **`id`** parameter to ensure that the **`id`** exists; otherwise, it will return a 404 page.

This check is easy to bypass, and I will explain the bypass method in **Trigger the vulnerability**.<br>

And then, when a POST request is made with the **`host_vars`** parameter, the variable **`host_vars`** will receive its value. The vulnerability is triggered at this point, as the value is then passed to `eval()` for execution as code.

## Trigger the vulnerability
After deploying the environment locally, the process appears quite complex, making it difficult to reproduce the vulnerability. Fortunately, I discovered an official public deployment of the system, so the following process will be carried out on the public deployment.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73d30fae-db2b-4c68-892e-5baeb821aa79)

Log in to the system using the demo account and open the user management interface. I have already added a low-privilege, login-only user named 'host' (with the password host123) using the demo account.

Clicking the ðŸš« icon on the right of the role shows the assigned permissions for that role. We can see that the 'host' user has no permissions assigned.

Log in to the system using **host:host123** and simultaneously capture the **csrftoken** from the `/login/` endpoint in BurpSuite.

Then, obtain the **sessionid** from any other requests and record them all.

Since `/api/host/vars/123/` is a Django REST API endpoint, and OpsManage has CSRF filtering enabled by default, if you try to access it directly with the **csrftoken** from `/login/`, you will see the message **'CSRF token missing or incorrect.'**<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/261670ec-4c8c-42f9-84de-8128d785e50b)<br>

I bypassed the middleware check by setting the **X-CSRFTOKEN** request header. Specifically, I set the value of **X-CSRFTOKEN** to match the **csrftoken** from the cookie.<br>

It returned a 404 page, which means we have at least entered the endpoint's execution logic. <br>
To obtain a valid **`id`**, I used an enumeration method to check which **`id`** would return a different response.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56710a11-2c0f-41fb-94fa-452f3867671d)<br>
Clearly, those are the ones.  

I used the `ping` command to verify the effect of command execution. After changing the **`id`** to **10** and adding the **`host_vars`** parameter with Python code, I sent the request.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6582dcc8-2a14-45d6-a741-96e4ff462a04)<br>
In the DNS log, I can see that the domain was requested, which indicates that the code execution was successful.

```

## Fix Recommendations
1. Add permissions for endpoint **deploy_host_vars**
2. Filter the value of **`host_vars`** to prevent unexpected code execution.
